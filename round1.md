Absolutely! Let's walk through **Round 1** of the mock interview questions with strong, realistic answers tailored to a **Wiz Solutions Engineer** candidate. Each answer is framed using the **Problem → Wiz Solution → Customer Benefit** format.

---

### **1. Explain how Wiz can help a customer detect a misconfigured IAM role that leads to a data breach.**

**Answer:**

A common issue in cloud environments is overly permissive IAM roles—for example, a compute instance or container running with admin privileges. Wiz connects directly to cloud APIs and pulls configuration data, identity relationships, and permissions.

Wiz’s **Security Graph** helps correlate multiple elements:

* A publicly exposed workload
* An exploitable vulnerability
* An IAM role with excessive permissions
* Access to sensitive resources like S3 or RDS

This allows Wiz to highlight not just individual risks, but **real attack paths**. For example, it can show that an EC2 instance exposed to the internet can be compromised, and that instance uses a role with S3 read/write access to customer data.

This visualization helps customers **prioritize what truly matters**, reducing the chance of data breaches from misconfigured IAM roles.

### **2. What makes Wiz different from traditional agent-based vulnerability scanners?**

**Answer:**

Traditional scanners rely on agents installed on every VM or container. This creates blind spots, slows down onboarding, and often causes operational friction.

Wiz takes an **agentless** approach—it connects via cloud APIs and **builds a full security graph** of the environment within minutes. It scans:

* Cloud configurations
* OS and package vulnerabilities
* IAM roles and identity permissions
* Workload data (via snapshot scanning)

This provides complete visibility **without any impact on runtime performance**. It also means **instant time to value**—customers can see findings within hours instead of weeks.

### **3. How would you explain Wiz’s Security Graph to a customer’s CISO?**

**Answer:**

The Security Graph is like Google Maps for cloud risk. Instead of just listing vulnerabilities, it shows how risks connect in **real-world attack paths**.

I would explain to the CISO that Wiz correlates misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, identity permissions, and exposed services into a single visual graph—allowing teams to:

* See which risks are chained together
* Prioritize fixes based on actual exploitability
* Focus limited resources on the most dangerous paths

It brings **context and clarity** to cloud security, helping align technical risk with business risk—something CISOs care deeply about.

### **4. A customer complains about alert fatigue from too many CVEs. How does Wiz help reduce noise and prioritize real risks?**

**Answer:**

Wiz doesn’t just report raw CVEs. It applies **contextual risk filtering** using its Security Graph.

Let’s say there are 500 CVEs in the environment. Wiz might reduce that to **10 truly critical ones** by showing:

* Whether the workload is exposed to the internet
* If the vulnerability is unpatched and actively exploited
* If it has access to sensitive data
* If there’s no defense-in-depth like EDR or firewall

This allows security teams to focus on what’s **actually exploitable**. Many customers tell us Wiz is the first tool that helps them "move from noise to action."

### **5. How can Wiz be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline? What value does that bring to DevSecOps teams?**

**Answer:**

Wiz offers pre-deployment scanning capabilities for CI/CD pipelines. It can scan:

* Kubernetes YAMLs
* Terraform, Helm, and CloudFormation templates
* Container images

This integration can be done using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, or Wiz’s CLI. When developers commit code, Wiz scans the IaC and images, and flags issues like:

* Privileged pods
* CVEs in base images
* Hardcoded secrets
* Misconfigured network access

The biggest value is that **security becomes part of development**, not a blocker after the fact. This accelerates delivery while still enforcing policy and compliance.

Would you like to continue with **Round 2** next? Or would you prefer to practice answering any of the above out loud and get feedback?
